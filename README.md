# Financial Data for Company Town

## Overview

I am creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of the company. The analysis will determine the company's financial health, indicating whether it is profitable. Additionally, the script will assess which months are most favorable for the company.

The above image shows the outcome of the financial data analysis. As depicted, the script calculates the company's profit and the average profit per month. It also highlights the minimum and maximum profits or losses to identify the best and worst months for the company.

This image represents the results of the town election data analysis. The script reveals that Khan was the winner with at least 60 percent of the vote, while O'Tooley received the fewest votes.
